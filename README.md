# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using RFM & K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a complete **Customer Segmentation Project** built using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** and **K-Means Clustering**. It also includes an **interactive Power BI Dashboard** for visualizing customer groups and generating actionable insights. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand customer behavior, identify high-value clients, re-engage at-risk customers, and create targeted marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project leverages **RFM metrics** along with **K-Means clustering** to automatically group customers into meaningful segments. The RFM model helps quantify customer behavior, and clustering aids in creating data-driven customer groups.

### RFM Definitions
- **Recency (R):** Days since last purchase  
- **Frequency (F):** Number of transactions  
- **Monetary (M):** Total amount spent  

After computing RFM values, a **K-Means model** segments customers into four behavior-based clusters.

## 🧩 Customer Segments

| Cluster | Description | Recommended Action |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|
| 🟦 **Cluster 0 – Loyal Customers** | Frequent buyers, strong monetary value | Strengthen loyalty programs & personalized offers |
| 🟪 **Cluster 1 – At-Risk Customers** | Long recency, declining engagement | Use win-back and reactivation campaigns |
| 🟧 **Cluster 2 – New Customers** | Recent sign-ups or first purchases | Encourage repeat purchases using onboarding offers |
| 🟨 **Cluster 3 – VIP Customers** | Highest spending customers | Offer premium benefits & exclusive product access |
